Logistic Regression and LDA (Linear Discriminative Analysis)

In this project, we investigated two classification models, logistic regression with gradient descent (LR) and linear discriminative analysis (LDA), and how they predict the binary outcome on two specific datasets, which are wine quality prediction set and breast cancer diagnosis set. We applied the heatmap correlation analysis on the different datasets and create a new subset of features, which slightly increased 2% of accuracy in the final test. We also showed that for both datasets with different feature data types, LDA model predicts more precisely and efficiently on both datasets, while LR model predicts the categorical dataset well when choosing a large learning rate. Meanwhile, we compared the different running time of the LDA model and LR model.  We also analysed the prediction result in depth by interpreting confusion matrix and discussed findings which would be studied in future research.
